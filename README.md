# **Kanban AI**

Kanban AI is your personal side project coach. Tell KAI what your side project SaaS idea is, along with the skills you want to add to your resume (e.g., React, Express, etc.), and KAI will generate a full 10-week plan to help you create it! Track your progress by updating the tasks KAI makes for you.

## **Setup**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The frontend will run on `localhost:5173` (default Vite dev server port).

## **Note**
The application uses Supabase for authentication and data storage. Without proper Supabase credentials in a `.env` file, you'll only be able to view the frontend interface.
