# kanban_ai

Kanban AI is your personal side project coach. Tell KAI what your side project SaaS idea is, along with what skills you want to add to your resume (e.g. React, Express, etc.), and he will give you a full 10-week plan for how to create it! Track your own progress by updating the tasks KAI makes for you.

## Setup
In Kanban_AI, run
```
npm install
```
Then run
```
npm run dev
```

This will run the frontend of the app. The backend of the app will be part of a separate repo. The database is also not automatically configured.

Once the backend is added to Github, it can be deployed with 'node server.js'.
